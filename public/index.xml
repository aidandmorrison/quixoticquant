      <description>A high-level response This post is a follow-on from my first post on this topic, where I suggested that an alternative statistic “Physically Present Population” suggested Australia’s migration rate might be overstated by “Net Overseas Migration” and the derived “Estimated Resident Population” might also be frothy as well. I’m glad that the piece had the intended effect, and provoked two published responses from Dr. Cameron Murray and Leith van Onselen. which I’ll address in some detail later on.</description>

      <description>The Brawl Begins This post is a follow-on from my first post on this topic, where I suggested that an alternative statistic “Physicaly Present Population” suggested Australia’s migration rate might be overstated by “Net Overseas Migration” and the derived “Estimated Resident Population”. I’m glad that the piece had the intended effect, and provoked two published responses from Dr. Cameron Murray and Leith van Onselen. which I’ll address in some detail later on.</description>

      <title>The Missing Million: Is Australia&#39;s migration rate actually high?</title>

      <description>It’s time that someone took a proper tilt at Australia’s high migration rate. No, I don’t mean like Dick Smith, splashing millions on an advertising campaign arguing that such a high rate is unsustainable and that we should return down to previous levels. I mean taking a few hours with the data source to figure out whether Australia’s migration rate actually is any higher than it was at previous levels.</description>

      <description>I think it’s worth a short post to explain where the name ‘Quixotic Quant’ came from.
Quixotic This word sums up my intent to use this blog to ‘tilt at windmills’, in the metaphorical style of Don Quixote. By ‘tilt’ I mean it as it’s meant in jousting. Take a direct charge against an idea and try to topple it, or at least have an exciting clash of intellectual arms, and hopefully have some fun and amuse onlookers while you’re at it.</description>

      <description>Aidan Morrison Originally trained as a physicist, I think these days I&amp;rsquo;m best described as an entrepreneur, with interests in data analytics, military technology, and hospitality.
Born and raised in Launceston, Tasmania, I attended Launceston Church Grammar School before moving to Canberra to study at the Australian National University. I completed a Bachelor of Science with First Class Honours. My majors were in Physics and Theoretical Physics, and my thesis was in Theoretical Particle Physics, on Kaon Decay in the Generation Model.</description>
